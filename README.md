# Sammy's**Lab**

This is my personal website.

All is built on a briliant stack of super interesting technologies such as Strapi, NuxtJS, Vuetify, Apollo-GraphQL and all that stuff that is making Web Development so quick and entertaining.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
